  bio: >- # tell to the world

    <p>I am currently a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell University, advised by Professors Fei Wang. My research focus is on integration of Electronic Health Record ang Genomics. <br><br>

    My academic trajectory has been both dynamic and interdisciplinary. I've delved into various facets of biomedical informatics, ranging from single-cell transcriptomics and database/web development to clinical informatics and oncoimmunology. 
    This multidisciplinary background equips me with the skills to navigate and integrate complex, heterogeneous biomedical data, thus positioning me to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in modern biomedicine.<br><br>

    Prior to joining Cornell, I earned my Master's degree in Biomedical Informatics from Harvard Medical School, where I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of Dr. Yevgeniy Semenov. 
    I completed my undergraduate studies in Biotechnology at Sun Yat-sen University, where I was mentored by Dr. Lingling Zheng. Additionally, I have gained practical experience during my time at 
    Massachusetts General Brigham.</p>
