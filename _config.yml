  I am a first-year CS PhD student at Cornell University, holding Master's degree in Biomedical Informatics from Harvard Medical School. 
  Currently co-advised by Fei Wang and Haiyuan Yu, my interest lies in multi-modal learning. Throughout my academic journey, I have pivoted
  to different areas in biomedical informatics, including single cell transcriptomics, database and web development, epidemiology, and oncoimmunonology.
  These diverse research experiences enpower me to cope with the exploding and heterogenous biomedical data, and integrate them to tackle the challenges
  in biomedicine.
