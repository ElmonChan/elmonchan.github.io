My undergraduate thesis, which was extended to a full paper titled 'A multi-omics platform for gene features analysis of virus receptors within human tissues and single cells', is now <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/14/5/516">online</a>

In this study, <a href="https://rna.sysu.edu.cn/gateview/index.php">GateView</a>, a multi-omics platform, was developed to analyze the gene features of virus receptors in human normal tissues and tumors. Serving as a valuable resource, it enables the exploration of common patterns among virus receptors and the investigation of virus tropism across different tissues, population preferences, virus pathogenicity, and oncolytic virus mechanisms.

I am honored to have work with Prof.Zheng during undergrate studies. I also want to express my gratitude to Yang Sun and Zi-Liang Huang. Without their work on downstream analysis and database refinement, this study would not have been published.
