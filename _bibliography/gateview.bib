ABSTRACT = {Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on cell surface receptor molecules to complete the first step of invading host cells. The experimental method for virus receptor screening is time-consuming, and receptor molecules have been identified for less than half of known viruses. This study collected known human viruses and their receptor molecules. Through bioinformatics analysis, common characteristics of virus receptor molecules (including sequence, expression, mutation, etc.) were obtained to study why these membrane proteins are more likely to become virus receptors. An in-depth analysis of the cataloged virus receptors revealed several noteworthy findings. Compared to other membrane proteins, human virus receptors generally exhibited higher expression levels and lower sequence conservation. These receptors were found in multiple tissues, with certain tissues and cell types displaying significantly higher expression levels. While most receptor molecules showed noticeable age-related variations in expression across different tissues, only a limited number of them exhibited gender-related differences in specific tissues. Interestingly, in contrast to normal tissues, virus receptors showed significant dysregulation in various types of tumors, particularly those associated with dsRNA and retrovirus receptors. Finally, GateView, a multi-omics platform, was established to analyze the gene features of virus receptors in human normal tissues and tumors. Serving as a valuable resource, it enables the exploration of common patterns among virus receptors and the investigation of virus tropism across different tissues, population preferences, virus pathogenicity, and oncolytic virus mechanisms.},
